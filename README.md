# R scripts and data to reproduce the analyses in:

Mammola S., et al. (2025). Subterranean environments contribute to three-quarters of classified ecosystem services. Biological reviews, in press (preprint available in EcoEvoRxiv, https://doi.org/10.32942/X2JM0S).

The folder contains all scripts and data to reproduce the analysis. 

The main dataset (Appendix S1, stored in the folder 'Data') provides a mapping of subterranean ecosystem services using the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES Version 5.1). Each classified service is assessed as either contributed (1) or not (0) by subterranean ecosystems, with the following breakdowns: any subterranean ecosystems, terrestrial, freshwater, and marine. Additional columns provide specific examples of services for each subterranean compartment, report the primary stakeholders benefiting from the service, indicate whether the service has been assessed quantitatively (1) or not (0), and include general references and notes.

Data in folder 'Data_map' are used to generate Figure 4. We refer to the paper for more details and sources.
